        <h2 class="sub-heading">Software</h2>
        <p class="post-text">In 2014, investor and entrepreneur Peter Thiel infamously posed the distinction between companies that deal in “atoms” versus those that deal in “bits.” In its crudest terms, the former category includes businesses focused on things like hardware and manufacturing; the latter, software and financial services. Just shy of 10 years on, the distinction now strikes as quaint, if not downright irrelevant.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Over the past five or so years, a new cohort of startups have emerged. In some ways, they resemble Silicon Valley of the 1950s rather than the 2010s: Eschewing Thiel’s distinction altogether, they broadly view bits and atoms as essentially inextricable, two hammers to strike the same nail. Few startups better embody this new paradigm than Atomic Industries.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Four-year-old Atomic is attempting to automate tool and die making, a critical step in manufacturing a wide swath of consumer and industrial products, from paper clips to aircraft components. The project is ambitious to the extreme — some injection molds are enormously complex, with tool and die makers functioning almost as alchemists transforming lead into gold. In addition, each product is unique, and requires the exact kind of generalizable intelligence humans have perfected over thousands of years of evolution.</p>
        <p class="post-text">But tool and die making is rigidly constrained by the geometry of the customer’s product: In this way, it’s alchemy that’s well-suited for machine-led, physics-based problem solving. Just as tool and die markers earn their stripes over a multi-year timespan, Atomic is designing an AI software stack that can become an ultra-efficient design engine for tools and molds, almost like a translation layer between what the customer wants to manufacture and the tool that will manufacture it.</p>
        <p class="post-text">“In my estimation, the world of atoms is worth 100x more than the world of bits as an industrial (and soon to be space-faring) society,” Atomic CEO and co-founder Aaron Slodov said. “It’s also orders of magnitude more difficult and expensive to innovate in. We’re starting to see how some of the most valuable companies on Earth are being valued so highly for their intersection of tech and atoms. Pushing the world of atoms towards the same pace as the world of bits is crucial.”</p>
