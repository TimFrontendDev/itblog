        <p class="post-text">Israeli startup Mine made a name for itself a few years ago with a tool designed for consumers to quickly run an audit of their data privacy situation. One scan of your inbox using AI and specifically natural language processing, and Mine can triangulate which companies have access to your personal data, and then let you delete that info in places where you didn’t want it to be. GDPR and other data privacy regulations were on people’s minds, and the tool — initially free, more recently paid — struck a chord: the startup racked up 5 million users in a blink.</p>
        <p class="post-text">For its next turn, the company expanded to business users and enterprise use cases. From a scan of an end user’s inbox and signing-on authenticator, Mine determines all of the places where that user is putting and using customer or business data. Again, it struck a chord, this time with privacy officers who are tasked with keeping companies privacy-rule compliant.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Now with enterprise users of its flagship MineOS in the hundreds, including Reddit, HelloFresh SE, FIFA and Data.ai, the company is announcing $30 million in Series B funding to continue its growth. Battery Ventures and PayPal Ventures are co-leading this round, with participation also from Nationwide Ventures (from the insurance giant) and all its previous backers, including Saban Ventures, Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI fund), MassMutual Ventures and Headline Ventures.</p>
        <p class="post-text">It’s not disclosing its valuation but co-founder and CEO Gal Ringel confirmed that it’s increased three-fold since its last fundraise. (That was a $9.5 million round in 2020, when it had just 100,000 users.) Mine has raised $42.5 million to date. The plan is to use the new funding both for sales development around its current offerings, but also to double down on R&D. In line with that, in Q1, Mine plans to launch two new products catering to the explosion in AI interest and usage.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The first of these is a product for data privacy officers designed to respond to regulators’ plans to introduce laws around AI.</p>
